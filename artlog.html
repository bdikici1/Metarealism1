        <h1>MetaRealism</h1>
        <p>1. Holes in the Heads of the Figures: The holes in the heads of the figures in his paintings symbolize the metaphor of information flow and data processing. These holes can be considered as a starting point with the brain's capacity to process data. 2. Circular Forms and Squares: Circular forms dominate his paintings, square forms are absent. While circular shapes symbolize a fluid and endless cycle, perhaps the continuity of energy; The square form is defined as the output of the first force. 3. Layered Structures and Energy: Your paintings are divided into three layers: force, matter and light (color and spectrum). These layers represent the movement and transformation of energy. In the visual, I can reflect these three layers, especially as the spread or focus of energy. 4. Using Data as a Source of Energy: Data is considered as a source of energy and powers the movement. I can represent this data as some kind of light or energy wave. 5. Mythological References and Psychological Layers: Defining data as light adds depth to the figures. Psychological and mythological elements are also part of the structure, so internal conflicts or deep thoughts may be included in the visual.</p>

            <p>Surrealism and hyperrealism, as movements, approached reality from different perspectives, but both focused on either visible or mental realities. In hyperrealism, the emphasis was particularly on copying the external world in its finest detail. As you mentioned, saying that reality is not merely a copy of what is visible becomes more meaningful with the technological and conceptual advancements of the modern era.

Today, “reality” is not just shaped by what we see, but also by perception, technology, time, and physical laws. In the field of painting, a method that combines these multiple layers seems to be missing. A new realism could encompass not only what is seen, but also the ways matter, time, energy, and processes express themselves. As you emphasize in your work, allowing nature and systems to reveal their own inner order without direct design might be a foundation for this new realism.

In this context, rather than simply copying what is visible, a new art movement that acknowledges the multidimensional nature of what we call “reality” could inspire a new realism. This kind of realism would explore the unseen interactions, the flow of time, and the boundaries of human intervention, alongside the material world.</p>
